A comprehensive starter template for building applications on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).

## Features

- React frontend with TypeScript

This will create a new project based on this boilerplate, with all dependencies installed and ready to go.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/icp-boiler-plate.git my-project
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd my-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
